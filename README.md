# credit_card_financial_dashbaord
## Project Objective: 
To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

## Dataset: 

Financial Dataset

## Data Processing Workflow

### Step 1: Data Cleaning in Excel

- We began by cleaning the raw data in Excel, addressing issues such as inconsistent date formats and other data anomalies. This step ensured that our dataset was consistent and ready for further analysis.

### Step 2: Loading Data into MySQL Database (ccdb1)

- Once the data was cleaned and formatted appropriately, we loaded it into our MySQL database named ccdb1. This allowed us to centralize our data storage and access it efficiently for further processing.

### Step 3: Data Transformation and Enrichment in Power BI

- Using Power BI, we connected to the ccdb1 database and retrieved the cleaned dataset. Through the power of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), we performed additional data transformations and created new calculated columns necessary for our visualization needs.

### Step 4: Dashboard Creation

- With the enriched dataset, we created two comprehensive dashboards: 
  - **Credit Card Customer Report**: Visualizes insights related to customer demographics, behavior, and trends.
  - **Credit Card Transaction Report**: Presents analysis and trends regarding transaction volumes, patterns, and anomalies.
